# Installation of tetres

Before using the package the c code contained in `/tetres/tetres/trees/` and in `/tetres/tetres/judgment` has to be manually compiled by running `make`, this needs openMP to be installed.
After that install the python package to your Python environment using the `pip install -e '/path/to/repo/tetres/'`.
